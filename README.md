## How to play

- Click **Start Game** or press **Space** to begin.
- Click the falling emojis to score.
- You have 30 seconds. Try to beat your high score!
- Reset clears the board.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (quickest)

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In the repo settings, go to **Pages**.
3. Select the `main` (or `master`) branch and `/ (root)` as the folder.

- Increase difficulty over time.
